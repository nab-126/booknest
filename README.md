# Booknest
## Description
Created a React-Native application to help locate the "Booknests" in Mauritius. The "Booknest" project aims to promote reading among the youth and to build community through sharing of books that are not used anymore.

## Roadmap
Improve the localization of the "Booknests" (add directions), allow the users to contact me if any of the Booknests need repairs or painting, allow users to track which books are in the Booknests, luanch of special events such as school material exchange before the start of the semester, and deploy the application to the Apple Store and Google Play Store.
